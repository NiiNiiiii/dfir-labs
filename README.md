# DFIR / Detection Engineering Portfolio

Hands-on DFIR, detection engineering, identity-focused detection, and cloud SecOps labs across Microsoft Sentinel, Microsoft Entra ID, Windows forensics, and AWS detection/response.

## Portfolio snapshot
- 7 completed labs
- 2 planned labs
- Reusable outputs: KQL, analytics exports, automation, workbooks, timelines, IOC packs, Terraform, Athena SQL, Lambda code, and evidence manifests

## What this portfolio shows
- Detection engineering, investigation, and response workflows across endpoint, identity, SIEM, and cloud
- Publish-safe, recruiter-reviewable lab documentation with reusable technical artifacts

## Start here
- [06 — Entra ID Detection Engineering + Gated Content Pipeline](labs/06-entra-id-detection-engineering-gated-content-pipeline/)  
  Identity-focused detection engineering in Sentinel with GitHub OIDC validation, packaging, approval gates, and controlled test deployment.

- [07 — AWS GuardDuty Detection + Response](labs/07-aws-guardduty-detection-response/)  
  AWS-native alerting, finding retention, Athena triage, Security Hub pivots, and a separate response workflow.

- [04 — Endpoint Forensics Casework](labs/04-endpoint-forensics-casework/)  
  Endpoint artifact triage, timeline building, IOC packaging, and Sentinel uplift from forensic findings.

- [05 — Windows Memory Forensics + Cloud SecOps Loop](labs/05-memory-forensics-cloud-secops-loop/)  
  Memory triage under cloud constraints, documented pivots, and hunt-to-response completion in Sentinel.

## Featured labs
| Lab | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [04 — Endpoint Forensics Casework](labs/04-endpoint-forensics-casework/) | Triage MFT and EVTX artifacts, build a timeline, package IOCs, and uplift findings into Sentinel content | ✅ Done |
| [05 — Windows Memory Forensics + Cloud SecOps Loop](labs/05-memory-forensics-cloud-secops-loop/) | Document Azure memory-acquisition constraints, pivot to process-memory proof, and complete the Sentinel hunt-to-response loop | ✅ Done |
| [06 — Entra ID Detection Engineering + Gated Content Pipeline](labs/06-entra-id-detection-engineering-gated-content-pipeline/) | Validate Entra telemetry, build identity detections and triage content, and prove a gated GitHub OIDC validation/package/test-deploy path into a separate Sentinel workspace | ✅ Done |
| [07 — AWS GuardDuty Detection + Response](labs/07-aws-guardduty-detection-response/) | Build AWS-native alerting, finding retention, Athena triage, and a Security Hub-driven response workflow | ✅ Done |

## Other completed labs
| Lab | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [01 — Telemetry + SIEM Validation](labs/01-telemetry-siem-validation/) | Validate AMA/DCR onboarding and prove Heartbeat, Sysmon, and Security event ingestion in Sentinel | ✅ Done |
| [02 — Multi-Host Incident Reconstruction](labs/02-incident-reconstruction/) | Correlate cross-host activity into a timeline and operationalize the result as detection, automation, and workbook content | ✅ Done |
| [03 — Controls-to-Telemetry Audit](labs/03-controls-to-telemetry-audit/) | Test which security controls are observable and document gaps with validation queries and a coverage matrix | ✅ Done |

## Planned
| Lab | Focus | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 08 — Secure EKS AI Platform | Planned flagship lab for GitHub OIDC deployment, EKS Pod Identity, signed-image enforcement, platform hardening, runtime detection, AI abuse telemetry, and Security Hub response | 📋 Planned |
| 09 — AWS IAM + S3 Misconfiguration Response | Planned posture and remediation lab focused on unintended access, attribution, and control validation | 📋 Planned |

## Core stack
Microsoft Sentinel, Log Analytics, Microsoft Entra ID, AMA/DCR, Sysmon, Windows Security Events, KAPE, MFTECmd, EvtxECmd, Timeline Explorer, Volatility 3, GitHub Actions, GitHub OIDC, Azure Bicep, Terraform, GuardDuty, Security Hub, EventBridge, SNS, Lambda, Athena, S3, CloudTrail, IAM Access Analyzer, and AWS Config.

## Notes
- Raw evidence is not published. The repo contains screenshots, queries, exports, templates, notes, manifests, and sanitized IOC material only.
- Labs that create billable cloud services include teardown or cleanup guidance.
